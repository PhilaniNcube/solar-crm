# Route Protection with Clerk Authentication

This document explains the authentication and route protection implementation using Clerk in your Next.js App Router application.

## 🔐 Route Protection Levels

### 1. Public Routes
- **Route:** `/` (Home page)
- **Access:** Available to everyone
- **Features:** Shows sign-in/sign-up buttons for unauthenticated users, dashboard links for authenticated users

### 2. Protected Dashboard Routes
- **Route:** `/dashboard` and all routes under `/(dashboard)/`
- **Access:** Requires authentication
- **Protection:** 
  - Middleware-level protection with `createRouteMatcher`
  - Server-side authentication check in layout
  - Automatic redirect to home page if not authenticated

### 3. Organization-Specific Routes
- **Route:** `/[slug]` (within dashboard route group)
- **Access:** Requires authentication AND organization membership
- **Protection:**
  - User must be authenticated
  - User must be a member of the specific organization
  - Returns 404 if user is not a member of the requested organization

## 🛡️ Implementation Details

### Middleware Protection (`middleware.ts`)
```typescript
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/(dashboard)(.*)',
]);

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    await auth.protect();
  }
});
```

### Dashboard Layout Protection
- Server-side authentication check using `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- Automatic redirect if user is not authenticated
- Includes `OrganizationSwitcher` for easy organization management

### Organization Route Protection
- Checks both `userId` and `slug` from `auth()`
- Compares current user's organization with requested organization
- Returns 404 for unauthorized access attempts

## 🔄 User Flow

1. **Unauthenticated User:**
   - Can access home page (`/`)
   - Cannot access `/dashboard` routes (redirected by middleware)
   - Cannot access organization routes

2. **Authenticated User (No Organization):**
   - Can access home page and dashboard
   - Cannot access organization-specific routes
   - Sees message to join an organization

3. **Authenticated User (With Organization):**
   - Full access to dashboard and their organization routes
   - Can switch between organizations using `OrganizationSwitcher`
   - Automatic access control based on organization membership

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Middleware-level protection** for performance and security
- **Server-side authentication** for reliable access control
- **Organization-based access control** using Clerk's built-in features
- **Clean redirects** and error handling
- **Type-safe** implementation with TypeScript
- **Responsive UI** with proper loading states

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

1. **Test Unauthenticated Access:**
   - Visit `/dashboard` → Should be redirected by middleware
   - Visit `/any-org-id` → Should be redirected

2. **Test Authenticated Access:**
   - Sign in → Should see dashboard link
   - Visit `/dashboard` → Should see dashboard content
   - Visit organization route → Access depends on membership

3. **Test Organization Access:**
   - Join an organization in Clerk
   - Visit organization-specific route → Should have access
   - Try accessing different organization → Should get 404

## 🔧 Customization Options

- **Custom redirect paths** in middleware
- **Access denied pages** instead of 404 for organizations
- **Role-based access control** within organizations
- **Custom authentication UI** with Clerk components
- **Branded appearance** for Clerk components

This implementation provides robust, scalable authentication with proper route protection for both user-level and organization-level access control.
